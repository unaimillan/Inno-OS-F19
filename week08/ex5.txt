Physical address is the address of something in real RAM hardware,
which is installed into the computer (2x8GB, for example) and
Virtual address is an address of something, what program can access to read or write to.
Nowadays physical addresses is accessible only by hardware called MMU,
and not accessible for common user level software,
so MMU map virtual address used by program into the real one with the use of page table.

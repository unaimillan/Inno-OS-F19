input1.txt - file with test data from Moodle
inputGood.txt - the same data, but sorted
inputBad.txt - the same data, but specifically shuffled

To increase hit/miss rate we just need to access the page before it will be removed from the cache.
E.g. if the cache size is 'N', the page 'i' should be accessed twice in any subsequence of size 'N'
In my case, sorted data from Moodle

To decrease hit/miss ration we need to access page at any time after it was thrown from cache.
E.g. if the cache size is 'N', the page 'i' should not be more than 1 time in any subsequence of size 'N'
In my case, specially constructed data from Moodle
